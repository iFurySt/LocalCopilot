# OpenCopilot
ðŸ¥³ OpenCopilot is an open source AI pair programmer. Inspired by the [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). 
And I decide to use the [CodeGemma-7b](https://huggingface.co/TechxGenus/CodeGemma-7b) or some similar SoTA code completion model to power it.

Feel free to join me :)

## Extensions
There are some open source extensions to IDE which can help you to use this AI pair programmer:
