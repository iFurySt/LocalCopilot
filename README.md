# LocalCopilot
ðŸ¥³ LocalCopilot is a local AI pair programmer. Inspired by the [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). 
And I decide to use the [CodeGemma-7b](https://huggingface.co/TechxGenus/CodeGemma-7b) or some similar SoTA code completion model to power it.

Feel free to join me :)
